# raycaster
My attempt at a raycaster engine

First I followed [3DSage's raycast tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA), this project would not be possible without that help.

Next I added some stuff in C++

I am stopping this where it is because I have no clue how to add textures based :(
