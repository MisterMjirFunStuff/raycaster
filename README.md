My attempt at a raycaster engine

First I followed [3DSage's raycast tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA), this project would not be possible without that help.

Now I am adding classes to make this more versatile and will soon try to implement enemies and other fun stuff (probably should start with collision).

I am still cleaning up a lot of the code, not really optimization wise but trying to remove some redundancy.
